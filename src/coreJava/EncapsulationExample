/*
 * The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden
 * from users. To achieve this, you must: declare class variables/attributes as
 * private provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of
 * a private variable
 * 
 * ----------------------------------------- Why Encapsulation? Better control
 * of class attributes and methods Class attributes can be made read-only (if
 * you only use the get method), or write-only (if you only use the set method)
 * Flexible: the programmer can change one part of the code without affecting
 * other parts Increased security of data
 * 
 * ------------------------- A package in Java is used to group related classes.
 * Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name
 * conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into
 * two categories:
 * 
 * Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API) User-defined Packages (create
 * your own packages)
 * 
 * To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import
 * keyword: --------------------
